## Type of Test Cases:
1. Equivalence Class
Any set of data that will produce a similar result
Valid Months (1-12), Invalid Months (<1, >12, not numeric)
2. Boundary Values
On, above, or below the edges of equivalence class
Valid Months (1, 12), Invalid Months(0, 13, XX)
3. Probable Error
Situations more likely to find a bug based on experience (yours or someone else's)
(Blank, null, 99, 00, _1, 1_)

Don't test the same old, same old over and over  
Edges are much more dangerous than flat surfaces  
If it's happened before, it'll happen again.
